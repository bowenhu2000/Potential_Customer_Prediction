FDS Project: Enhanced Customer Insights and Classification
This project involves analyzing customer data to generate actionable insights, perform clustering for segmentation, and build predictive classification models using Python and various machine learning techniques.

Features
Clustering:

Utilized K-Means clustering to segment customers based on behavioral metrics such as order cost, ratings, and delivery times.
Applied feature scaling and cleaning to ensure data quality for clustering.
Classification:

Built classification models using Logistic Regression and Random Forests to predict customer satisfaction.
Achieved 83% accuracy through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
Visualization:

Generated insights through visualizations such as feature importance charts and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
Technologies Used
